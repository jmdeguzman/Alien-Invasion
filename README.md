# Alien-Invasion
A simple Space Invaders clone to deepen my understanding of classes in OOP 

To play the game(For Windows):
1. Make sure python is installed
2. Open the command prompt and change the directory to where "alien_invasion.py" is located
3. Enter the following in the command prompt: "python alien_invasion.py"
4. Controls are arrow keys for movement and spacebar for shooting
5. "ctrl + q" to exit the game
